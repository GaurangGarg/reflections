When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

If your local machine goes down, you'll have a copy on a remote machine - github servers.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You might be making changes to the files that are being pulled and would rather
push your own copy later on.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

Forks allow you to clone a repo onto github servers.
Clone allows you to clone repo onto your local server.
Branches allow you to create multiple versions with different commits on your local.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

You can do a fetch to update the state of the remote stored locally so you have
access to all the changes made by other collaborators. 

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

It would be much harder to review code and work on your separate branch without git
or github. It would be hard to share code without github.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

When working on a bug or new feature. It lets you explore/make changes that won't 
affect the master branch which we know works.
